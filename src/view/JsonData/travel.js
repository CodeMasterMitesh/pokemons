While no one knows exactly who built the Ruins of Alpha, research suggests that the people in question were an ancient civilization who wished to coexist with the enigmatic Unown, which bear a striking resemblance to the letters of the alphabet. Not only did this tribe write messages on the walls of the ruins describing the Unown, but they also erected a statue of Pokémon for an unknown reason.</font></font></p>`,

Their arguments divided the single dragon into Reshiram, who appeared with the older brother, and Zekrom, who appeared with the younger brother. Since they were both born of the same dragon, neither could defeat the other, and the brothers declared that there was no right side.</font></font></p>`,
